Title: Evolution of life expectancy
For most of humanity, life was short, indeed the average life expectancy was under, but it is now 
what changed in a short period of time.


Life expectancy (World, 1770–2023) → long historical series.
DTP vaccination coverage (Global, 1980s–2024) → short modern series.


“Historical estimates of water and sewerage coverage (Gallardo-Albarrán, 2024) show how sanitation spread unevenly across the world — with Northern Europe reaching near universal coverage by 1900, while parts of Asia and Latin America lagged behind until the mid-20th century.”
